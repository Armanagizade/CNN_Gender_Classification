This project implements a gender classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on fingerprint images. The goal is to classify gender (male or female) based on fingerprint patterns. The project is developed using Python and leverages libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and NumPy.

Results

The CNN model provides high accuracy in gender classification tasks on the dataset used:
